# Candlestick Clusters using K-Means 

In this project, we will explore K-Means clustering in unsupervised learning method that identifies separate price action clusters on candlestick data. In our example, we're applying K-Means Clustering on SPDR Gold Shares(gold-backed ETF) to visualise candlestick clusters chart. We will also create the cluster matrix that describes the probability of cluster *i* to cluster *j*, which is useful for forming predictive trading strategies based on today's cluster identification and prediction of subsequent cluster. The output of the candlestick clusters and cluster matrix are as shown as below:
